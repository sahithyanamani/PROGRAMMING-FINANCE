Write a program that according to the given formula below, calculate the compound interest.

The following is a standardized function name in this assignment to calcuate the results.  Please remember the main() is only a test program that tests the function compdInterestCcltr.

Please include the debugPrint() to your code, exercise the 5 levels of severities concept during your coding.  Please submit a zip file that compresses a directory where your source code and a readme file can be found.  The readme file should explain how to run your program and explain the layout of your program.

double compdInterestCcltr(double principle, float period, float itrstRate, int periodNum);

The compound interest formula is:  A = P (1+r/n)nt

Where:

A = Future value of the investment

P = Principal amount invested

r = The rate of interest (decimals)

n = Number of times interest gets compounded per period

t = Number of periods the money is invested for
