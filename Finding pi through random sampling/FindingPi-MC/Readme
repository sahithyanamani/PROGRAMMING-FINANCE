Working:
- The main class asks the user to input number of iterations.
- the values of coradinates are randomly generated.
we take input for no of iterations. We loop through each iteration
and generate random x and y points. 
If x^2 + y^2 <= 1 then I increament the count of pounts falling inside the circle by 1.
In a square containing the quadrant circle. The value of pi will be - 
pi = 4 * darts hitting the circle / darts hitting the square
