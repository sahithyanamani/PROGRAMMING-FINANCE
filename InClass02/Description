Please submit a zip file including your 3 coding files. Also please add comments to describe your code.

Read through all the sample codes provided to you under Class03. Understand the following points;
how to implement a class object in c++ with both 2-file-separation and 3-file-separation. 
Understand what is inexplicit conversion, how to avoid it using the “explicit” keyword. 
Understand how initializer list works
Understand how constant function and constant variable works, and how they are different from each other. 
Understand how to manipulate class objects using set() and get() member functions. 
Write a code in which you create your own class object, and your class object should meet the following requirements: 
Implement your class, and organize your code in to 3 separate file (main.cpp, class header file, and class implementation.cpp) 
The class constructor must contain the “explicit” keyword, and in the form of an initializer list. 
Implement set(), get() member functions in your class
In the main function, you must showcase how to instantiate your class (create a class object), and manipulate class data members via using set and get function.
