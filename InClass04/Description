Carefully review and fully understand textbook 6.10, 6.11, 6.12.  Especially when you work on your recursive program, keep the subjects of Function-Call Stack, Stack Frames, Automatic Variables and Stack Frames in mind, and review the code example in 6.20 and 6.21.

Write a recursive method countBinStr that takes one integer parameter n as input, and returns the number of binary strings of length n that do not have two consecutive 0's. For example, for n = 4, the number of binary strings of length 4 that do not contain two consecutive 0's is 8, and they are: 1111, 1110, 1101, 1011, 1010, 0111, 0110, 0101
