Steps to run the code:
1. Unzip the .zip folder
2. Go to command prompt to open the file where it has been saved
3. Type command  g++ VectorFinal.cpp and press enter to compile the code for vector implentation
4. Now type ./a.out command to run the code.
5. Type command  g++ new.cpp and press enter to compile the code for matrix implementation.
6. Now type ./a.out command to run the code.

Working of both the implemntation si the same, just the way the data values are stored is diffrent.

-in the main file we declare choice and a do while loop is executed such that the menu will be displayed
atlest once. The condition fails when the user inputs 7 which is exit from program
- Then the program prompts the user to enter matrix values depending upton the choice.
- if they want to perform addition, substraction and multiplication then prompts to enetr two matrices
- else only one matrix
- the switch choice:
    switch (choice)
        {
        case 1:
            //addition
            break;
        case 2:
            //Subtraction
            break;
        case 3:
            //Multiplication
            break;
        case 4:
            //determinant 
            break;
        case 5:
            //Transpose
            break;
        case 6:
            //Inverse
            break;
        case 7:
            exit(0);
            break;
        default:
            cout << "Enter Your Choice" << endl;
            break;
        }
- Addition is performed on any matrix with any dimension but just that both the matrices must have same dimensions.
- Substraction is performed on any matrix with any dimension but just that both the matrices must have same dimensions.
- Multiplication is performed only when the col a and row b dimensions match.
- determinant is performed only when the matix size is 3x3
- Inverse is performed only when the matix size is 3x3
- Transpose is performed with nxm
